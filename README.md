>DKE Master Research Project 18 - Competition: Create University Timetables

## Goals 🥇
Create an educational scheduling system from scratch for the DKE and test different approaches.

Find out if free OSS solvers are better than expensive ones to solve the scheduling problem and if these free options can be improved.

### Secondary objectives 🥈
It should be easy to input data to our algorithms.

If it works, try to generalize it.

Make a user interface.

## To-Do list 📑
- [x] Initial meeting with supervisor
- [ ] Research state-of-the-art
- [ ] Model problem as an ILP
- [ ] Talk to Denise (scheduler at DKE) - ask her what the priorities are when it comes to the constraints
- [ ] Create a google form to extract students priorities
- [ ] Implement a basic greedy approach
- [ ] Online re-scheduling (professor is sick, unplanned events...)
- [ ] Mental wellbeing - efficiency of scheduling
- [ ] Generalize software for the whole UM


## Deliverables 📦
**Phase 1**
- Software that can run several algorithm implementations.
